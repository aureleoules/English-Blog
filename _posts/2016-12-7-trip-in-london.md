title: My trip to London
---
I absolutly wanted to visit the UK with my wife, especially London because it's the capital of the England. To travel there, I took the train called Eurostar, in a few hours I was there for the first time!  

I was so impress to be in London, this was my dream. When I took the underground, I was completely lost because it(s totally different from the Paris' one.  

When I was on the way to my hotel, I've noticed some red telephone boxes. This made me laugh because it's a well-known stereotype. For my first days, I've made many English mistakes. The British accent is very particular.  

The second day. I was eager about walking on the Tower Bridge which is located over the River Thames. This was very impressive. Then I ate in a small restaurant. I ordered a typical British launch: A fish & chips.  

I also wanted to see the Changing of the Royal Guards at the Buckingham Palace (a must-see!). There were many tourists watching the show.
In the evening, I took a red double decker bus to go to the Piccadilly Circus.

It’s a place with a fountain in the center, and many popular shops (like Burger King®…). At the same time I saw the Big Ben with the bells ringing. Then I went back to my hotel, exhausted, I turned on the TV and watched the BBC.  

The next day, it was already Sunday, I ate a traditional brunch with scrambled eggs, bacon, meat, potatoes…
Shopping Time! I promised to my wife, that we’ll go shopping one day! And there it is...  
We firstly went to the most popular and luxury department store: Harrods. It’s a big store with many articles for wealthy people. Then we wanted to make a present to our children as a British souvenir, because they are currently at my parents’ house. We also went to Hamleys a very famous toys shop of London. There, the vendors are very kind and welcoming! The shop is extremely huge with many flours.  
Right after my wife ruined me, we... [pas fini]
