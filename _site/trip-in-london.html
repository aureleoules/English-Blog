		<p>I <strong>absolutly</strong> wanted to visit the <strong>UK</strong> with my wife, especially <strong>London</strong> because it’s the capital of the England.<br />
To travel there, I took the train called <strong>Eurostar</strong>, in a few hours I was there for the first time!</p>

<p>I was so <strong>impressed</strong> to be in London, this was my dream. When I took the <strong>underground</strong>, I was completely lost because it’s totally different from the Paris’ one.<br />
On the way to my hotel, I’ve noticed some <strong>red telephone boxes</strong>. This made me laugh because it’s a well-known stereotype. For my first days, I’ve made many English mistakes. The British accent is very particular.</p>

<p>The second day. I was eager about walking on the <strong>Tower Bridge</strong> which is located over the <strong>River Thames</strong>. This was very impressive. Then I ate in a small restaurant, I ordered a typical British launch: A <strong>Fish &amp; Chips</strong>.</p>

<p>I also wanted to see the <strong>Changing of the Royal Guards</strong> at the Buckingham Palace (a must-see!). There were many tourists watching the show.</p>

<p>In the evening, I took a red double decker bus to go to the <strong>Piccadilly Circus</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s a place with a fountain in the center, and many popular shops (like Burger King®…). At the same time I saw the Big Ben with the bells ringing. Then I went back to my hotel, exhausted, I turned on the TV and watched the BBC.</p>

<p>The next day, it was already Sunday, I ate a traditional brunch with scrambled eggs, bacon, meat, potatoes…<br />
Then, <strong>Shopping Time!</strong> I promised to my wife, that we’ll go shopping one day! And there it is…<br />
We firstly went to the most popular and luxury department store: <strong>Harrods</strong>. It’s a big store with many articles for wealthy people. Then we wanted to make a present to our children as a British souvenir, because they are currently at my parents’ house.</p>

<p>We also went to <strong>Hamleys</strong> a very famous toys shop of London. There, the vendors are very kind and welcoming! The shop is extremely huge with many flours.<br />
Right after my wife ruined me, we had a walk and ended up [<strong>NOT FINISHED!</strong>]</p>
