		<p>I absolutly wanted to visit the UK with my wife, especially London because it’s the capital of the England. To travel there, I took the train called Eurostar, in a few hours I was there for the first time!</p>

<p>I was so impress to be in London, this was my dream. When I took the underground, I was completely lost because it(s totally different from the Paris’ one.</p>

<p>When I was on the way to my hotel, I’ve noticed some red telephone boxes. This made me laugh because it’s a well-known stereotype. For my first days, I’ve made many English mistakes. The British accent is very particular.</p>

In the evening, I took a red double decker bus to go to the Piccadilly Circus.</p>

<p>The next day, it was already Sunday, I ate a traditional brunch with scrambled eggs, bacon, meat, potatoes…
Shopping Time! I promised to my wife, that we’ll go shopping one day! And there it is…<br />
We firstly went to the most popular and luxury department store: Harrods. It’s a big store with many articles for wealthy people. Then we wanted to make a present to our children as a British souvenir, because they are currently at my parents’ house. We also went to Hamleys a very famous toys shop of London. There, the vendors are very kind and welcoming! The shop is extremely huge with many flours.<br />
Right after my wife ruined me, we… [pas fini]</p>
